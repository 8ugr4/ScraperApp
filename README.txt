// Goal is to implement object oriented understanding into to ScraperApp by using different objects and files.

// Implement file, dnsResolver and directory ideas.

// don't forget to run it with " go run ."  (maybe also there's an option to run a file
// with all the other files in the same project, but i probably did not choose it at the start
// because it was a single file project.
// learn how to change that.

// otherwise it's not gonna see the other files.

// extra note, more study on oop with golang.
